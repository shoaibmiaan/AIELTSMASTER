      "title": "Timekeeper 2 Invention of Marine Chronometer",
      "body": "A. It was, as Dava Sobel has described, ‘the greatest scientific problem of the age’. In the 18th century, clocks could not withstand the motion and temperature shifts at sea while keeping accurate time...\n\nB. The longitude is a measure of how far around the world one has come from home...\n\nC. Navigators were unable to determine their position at sea accurately...\n\nD. The simple answer is to bring a clock set to home time...\n\nE. In 1714, a reward of £20,000 was offered to anyone who could solve the problem of measuring longitude...\n\nF. This inspired John Harrison to build a marine clock...\n\nG. H4, his final design, looked like a pocket watch...\n\nH. John Hadley developed the sextant to measure angles...\n\nI. Later improvements were made by pioneers like Pierre Le Roy and Thomas Earnshaw.",
